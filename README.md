# ecommerce-customer-insights
This project is focused on analyzing eCommerce data to understand customers, products, and transactions. The tasks included data analysis, building a lookalike model, and grouping customers into clusters.

# Data Analysis

I analyzed the datasets provided for customers, products, and transactions. The analysis helped me understand:

Customer distribution by region: I created a chart to visualize how customers are spread across different regions.

Revenue by product category: Another chart showed which product categories generated the most revenue. These insights were helpful in identifying key trends and patterns in customer behavior and product performance.

# Lookalike Model

I built a lookalike model that finds similar customers based on their transaction history. For the first 20 customers, the model recommends the top 3 similar customers. These results are saved in the file Lookalike.csv. This feature can be useful for targeted marketing or personalized offers.

# Customer Segmentation

Using clustering techniques, I grouped customers into 4 distinct clusters based on their transaction data. This helped uncover patterns in customer behavior, such as spending habits or purchase preferences. The clustering results are saved in the file Clustering_Results.csv. These clusters can help businesses develop tailored strategies for different customer groups.

# Visualizations

To make the insights easier to understand, I created several visualizations:

Customer Distribution by Region: Saved as customer_distribution_by_region.png, this chart shows how customers are distributed across regions.

Revenue by Product Category: Saved as revenue_by_product_category.png, it highlights which product categories contribute the most to revenue.

Customer Segmentation Clusters: Saved as customer_segmentation_clusters.png, this plot illustrates how customers are grouped into clusters.

Learning Outcomes

This project taught me how to work with real-world eCommerce data and derive actionable insights. I learned how to analyze datasets, build predictive models, and use clustering to segment customers. These skills have improved my understanding of data-driven decision-making and business strategies.
